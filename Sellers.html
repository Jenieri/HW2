        <p class="my-4">Shoes must be in Deadstock (brand new) condition, with box and original laces included.</p>

        <p class="my-4">We accept all sizes, but are mostly looking for US men's sizes between 9-15</p>
        
        <p class="my-4">To sell sneakers you should email Jenieri at jeniericyrus@sneakers.com with a picture of the shoe from the side, from above, and a picture of the sole. </p>

        <p class="my-4">Once your submission has been reviewed, Jenieri will get back to you ASAP with a quote. Offers are non-negotiable.</a></p>

        <p class="my-4">Jenieri will grant 115% of the quoted offer to be used as store credit if you would like to purchase a sneaker that is in stock.</p>

        <p class="my-4">All shoes go through our in-house authentication system. Cash will not be released until the sneakers are verified to be authentic. Any sneakers that fail authentication will be sent back to seller.</p>

        <p class="my-4">Payment will be facilitated via Venmo, Cash App, or any other payment portal of your choice.</p>

        <p class="my-4">If you have any other questions about selling sneakers, reach out to Jenieri via email at jeniericyrus@sneakers.com or give him a call at 999-999-9999</p>
